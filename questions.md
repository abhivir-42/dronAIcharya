Q1: What is the problem you are solving? (50 words max)

Q2: Describe your solution. How different is it from any of the other existing ideas? How will it be able to solve the problem? USP of the proposed solution? What is the intended impact of your solution (max 350 words).

Q3: Who is the primary user of your solution, and explain how your solution will leverage open-source AI to address the aspects mentioned in the Key Design Guidelines (max 200 words).

Q4: How is this solution scalable? (100 words max)

Q5: List of features offered by the solution
It is always better to add a few visual representations (drawings/sketches/illustrations etc.) to your presentation, it adds to the power through which it reaches the audience.
