# Essential Considerations

## Key Design Guidelines

### Technical Realities
- **Connectivity:** Unreliable/low-bandwidth internet
- **Devices:** Basic smartphones or feature phones, shared devices
- **Power Reliability:** Frequent power outages

### User Context
- **Digital Literacy:** Limited tech familiarity
- **Language:** Must support regional languages
- **Trust:** Skepticism toward new technologies

### Resource Limitations
- **Economic:** Low ability to pay for services
- **Data:** Sparse historical data for AI model training
- **Expertise:** Limited on-ground technical support

### Ethical Considerations
