# How is this solution scalable? (100 words max)

DronAIcharya will be built using a modular, microservices-based architecture with containerized deployment (via Docker and Kubernetes) ensuring scalability. Its open-source foundation enables community contributions for ongoing improvements. The platform will support offline caching and adaptive resource usage, allowing it to scale efficiently even in low-bandwidth environments. Each service—personalized tutoring, content generation, and analytics—can be independently scaled based on demand, ensuring robust performance as user numbers grow.
