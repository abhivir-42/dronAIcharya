# Does your solution require cloud-based computation, or can it work with on-device processing? If cloud-based, how do you plan to address connectivity challenges and cost constraints?

DronAIcharya employs a hybrid approach, combining on-device processing with optional cloud computing to address India's connectivity challenges:

## Hybrid Architecture
- **Core Functionality**: Essential features run entirely on-device, ensuring functionality during connectivity lapses.
- **Advanced Processing**: Heavy computational tasks like content generation utilize cloud resources when available.

## On-Device Components
- **Lightweight AI Models**: Optimized with ONNX Runtime and OpenVINO for efficient local inference.
- **Local Data Storage**: SQLite and embedded NoSQL databases store essential content and student data.
- **Offline Application Logic**: Complete teaching management tools function without internet access.
- **Content Caching**: Educational materials are proactively downloaded during connectivity.

## Connectivity Challenge Solutions
- **Asynchronous Synchronization**: Updates occur incrementally when connectivity is available, prioritizing critical data.
- **Low-Bandwidth Mode**: Automatically adjusts content quality based on connection speeds.
- **Mesh Networking**: Optional peer-to-peer sharing between nearby devices when internet access is unavailable.
- **SMS Fallback**: Critical notifications can be delivered via SMS in extreme connectivity constraints.

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Edge Computing**: Distribute processing across local school networks where possible.
- **Resource Pooling**: Schools in proximity share computational resources.
- **Tiered Cloud Usage**: Free tier for basic schools, with subsidized premium features for enhanced capabilities.
- **Cached Cloud Operations**: Batch cloud requests to minimize API calls and data transfer costs.
- **Open-Source Cloud Deployment**: Self-hosted options for organizations with technical capability.

This hybrid approach ensures DronAIcharya remains functional and valuable regardless of connectivity status, while minimizing operational costs for resource-constrained educational environments.
